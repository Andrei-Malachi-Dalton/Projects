        <h1>The Best Movies According to Andrei</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Mummy (1993)</h3>
        <p>My favorite movie ever. Leagues better than the Tom Cruise remake. Just a silly, thriller/horror film.</p>
        <h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>
        <p>One of the first movies I've ever sat through. Have some good memories of watching this with my mother</p>
        <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
        <p>Will always be one of my favorite Miyazaki films. Very whimsical.</p>
